parsely
=======

A parser. It currently only parses person names. 

Based on Matthew Ericson's people gem: https://github.com/mericson/people which, in turn, is loosely based on 
the Lingua-EN-NameParser Perl module.

To set up development environment clone the repo and run `bundle` to get all of the dependencies.
